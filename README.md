<h1>Tip Calculator </h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
This Python program helps you calculate how much each person should pay for a bill, including a tip. You enter the total bill amount, the percentage of tip you want to give, and how many people are splitting the bill. It then computes the total bill with tip, divides it by the number of people, and shows how much each person needs to pay. The program guides you through each step and ensures all inputs are correct. It's handy for quickly figuring out shared expenses at restaurants or events.
